= render_htmldoc_pdf

== Summary

Rails plugin to integrate the htmldoc executable and Ruby PDF::HTMLDoc gem with
and ActionView

== Prerequisites

* You'll have to download, compile, and install the htmldoc executable. You can get
  it from {the HTMLDoc website}[http://www.htmldoc.org/]. The latest developer
  snapshot (1.9.x as of this writing) works just fine. If you're on a Windows machine,
  you can get 1.8 from the Cygwin repos.
* The htmldoc gem. Just <tt>gem install htmldoc</tt>.

== Usage

Views that you want converted to PDF must have an 'rpdf' extension.

You have two methods available in your controllers to run them through HTMLDoc: <tt>render_pdf</tt> and
<tt>render_pdf_to_file</tt>. Take a look at lib/controller.rb for more.

== Bugs

Currently ERB blows up if you try to render a partial within an .rpdf. So don't do that.
